# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Overview
This project focused on the object oriented programming paradigm in that everything in Python was an object. We learned about how all variable references are actually instances of a data type class. Additionally, we learned the difference between immutable and mutable objects and aliasing as well as how Python passes variables to functions.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Text Files
* Only one line
* No shebang
* All files should end with new line

## Tasks
### Mandatory

The only script is as follows:
**[19-copy_list.py](19-copy_list.py)** - Returns a copy of a list
* Input list contains any type of objects
* Maximum of three lines
* no imported module
